    <p>Chef John's cabbage roll soup tastes exactly like Polish-style cabbage rolls, because it has all the same ingredients. This delicious and comforting one-pot soup satisfies the exact same craving, but involves a fraction of the work.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups beef broth, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>3 cups canned crushed or puréed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup long grain white rice</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped Italian parsley, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Set a soup pot over medium-high heat and melt butter. Add onion and salt, and cook, stirring, until onions turn soft and translucent, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and cook, stirring and breaking up large clumps, until meat is browned and broken into small crumbles, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Season with garlic, black pepper, cayenne, and bay leaf; cook and stir for 1 minute. Pour in beef broth, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Stir in cabbage, reduce heat to medium, and cook until cabbage is just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in tomatoes and water, and continue to simmer, 10 to 15 minutes more. Stir in rice and half the parsley; simmer over medium heat until rice is tender and soup thickens, about 20 minutes. If soup becomes too thick as it simmers, add a little more beef broth and/or water. Season to taste with salt.</li>
    </ol>
