        <li>2 teaspoons furikake(optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons everything bagel seasoning</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lime juice</li>
        <li>2 sliced green onions, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment or foil.</li>
        <li>Place salmon on the baking sheet; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, lemon pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Drizzle oil over salmon.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until salmon just starts to flake easily with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool slightly before breaking up into small pieces. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine rice, water, and remaining salt in a sauce pan. Bring to a boil, stir once, reduce heat to low, and cover. Cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and fluff with a fork.  Stir in rice vinegar and let cool.</li>
        <li>When salmon is cooled, add it to a bowl with crab, cream cheese, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1 ½ tablespoons Sriracha, and soy sauce, and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish; add rice and press into an even layer. Crush nori sheets over rice and sprinkle with furikake. Spread salmon mixture over seaweed; sprinkle evenly with everything seasoning.</li>
        <li>Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) until browned around the edges, about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir remaining 1/2 cup mayonnaise, remaining 1 ½ tablespoons Sriracha, and lime juice together. Drizzle over casserole before serving; top with green onions and avocado.</li>
    </ol>
